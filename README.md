# raylib-Asteroids
This repo was created as a resource for my [tutorial](https://youtu.be/abIlGCx_Yq8) on Andrew Hamel Codes.

I promise I will get around to making a real readme soon ðŸ˜…

## To Build
GitHub doesn't like me including empty folders in my repos, so create an "obj" folder in the root of the repo before trying to build or it might get angry! If you open the repo's folder in VSCode and simply press F5, it should work. Double check the path variables in the Makefile to make sure they point to Raylib on your machine if the linker fails. You can also invoke `make` from the root of the project to build.
